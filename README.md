# Decision-Trees--The Sparks Foundation

This Decision Tree project has been made as part of my Data Science and Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation (TSF).

## DECISION TREES
It is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which can be used for both classification as well as regression. In this project, we will be using Decision Trees as a classifier.

The goal of this algorithm is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable, for which the decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem. The leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the tree.

Leaf node refers to a node with zero children.

Internal nodes refer to nodes with children.


After importing the dataset, we visualise it using a pairplot, below is how the visualisation appears.
